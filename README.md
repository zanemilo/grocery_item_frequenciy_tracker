    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This porject is a program modeled after the potential need of a Corner Grocer store that needs me to build a item-tracking program. The program analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. So this program tells the user the frequency of each item added to the stores records.


    What did you do particularly well?

Particularly, I did well abstracting the requirements of this program before hand. By mapping out the general flow of the program in my minds eye before touching anything I was able to gain a substatial idea of how to accomplish this task. The way my mind tends to group these ideas is modeled after OOP principles and I believe I excelled at crerating a program that emulates the best use of those principles.


    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Areas of this code that may be enhanced would be in the GUI. Currently this program runs in CLI but would be much better suited with a desktop application GUI. I could use python and it's framework kivy to create a robust and simple to implement GUI.


    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
The most difficult part of the code to write was iterating over a dynamically sized vector depending on the contents of the grocers records. I overcame this by reviewing the coursework and zybook to find how to best accomplish this using for loops, and vector methods '.begin()' and '.end()'.


    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

All of the skills used in this project are transferable. Since this project follows every step from the conception of the idea to creating a workable prototype, the skills and tools used during the development of this project can be utilized in future obstacles. From this project abstraction, encapsulation, good use of white space, in-line comments, and documentation based on the program are all skills that I will use time and time again in the future.
    
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  By using a class based program structure, updating, reading and adapting this program I have enabled my self to be able to not get bogged down repeating myself or implementing features that are not going to be used and isntead maintain an environment where any adaptations need only be made in one location but those changes will perpetuate throughout the code as it is all written in an OOP approach which fosters maintainability.
